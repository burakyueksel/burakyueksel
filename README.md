- 👋 Hi, I’m @burakyueksel
- 👀 I’m an expert in control theory and robotics, especially in flight control. This means: automated flight, path planning and tracking,
position/velocity/attitude controls, multirotor/fixed-wing/VTOL controls, onboard state estimation and localization.
- 🌱 I’m learning every day more about neural networks and their pragmatic usage for robotics and aviation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on control theory and robotics in general.
- 📫 How to reach me: mail.burakyuksel@gmail.com
